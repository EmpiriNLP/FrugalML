In addition, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance.

We recorded a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to receivables of $7.6 million, an increase to inventories of $2.8 million, an increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.9 million, an increase to other accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase to other noncurrent liabilities of $0.2 million. The adjustments primarily related to the timing of recognition of certain customer charges, trade promotional expenditures, and volume discounts. \\nParagraph 2:\\nThe effect of the changes made to our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 26, 2019 for the adoption of Topic 606 was as follows: \\nParagraph 3:\\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued) Fiscal Years Ended May 26, 2019, May 27, 2018, and May 28, 2017 (columnar dollars in millions except per share amounts) The question is asked based on the data in the table and the paragraph.
