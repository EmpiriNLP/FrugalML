# Frugal ML

This project is part of the COMP0087: Statistical Natural Language Processing module at University College London (UCL). The primary objective is to compare the computational resources required by different combinations of training techniques and models to achieve a specified performance level. Performance will be evaluated using Exact Match Accuracy (EmAcc), while computational cost will be measured in Floating Point Operations (FLOPs).
